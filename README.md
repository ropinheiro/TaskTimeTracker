# TaskTimeTracker

## Introduction
Development of a Task Time Tracker application to help me track my time
in the different tasks I perform in one day, for multiple contexts
(work, learning, volunteering and personal).

Current features:
* Add / remove tasks
* Start / stop timers associated to tasks

Roadmap:
* Save / load data
* Archive / un-archive tasks
* Log periodic time reports
* Order tasks by drag-and-drop
* Manually edit tracked time
