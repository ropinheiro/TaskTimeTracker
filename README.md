# Task Time Tracker by RMP @ Together - Estamos Juntos

## Introduction
This application was built to help me tracking my time
in the different tasks I perform in one day, for multiple contexts.
Meanwhile, I thought it would be useful for someone else, so, here you have :)

Current features:
* Add / remove tasks
* Start / stop timers associated to tasks
* Save / load data

Roadmap:
* Log periodic time reports
* Archive / un-archive tasks
* Order tasks by drag-and-drop
* Manually adjust the time

Extra things you can do by editing TaskData.json (with the application closed!):
* Edit the elapsed times
* Change the order of the tasks

When the application is opened, it loads this file. The tasks will be rendered in the order they appear in the file and all descriptions and elapsed times (in seconds) will be filled. All tasks load in stopped status.

## Current Release

This is still in development.

But feel free to clone the repository and build it.


## Development Environment

For the development, you only need Visual Studio 2019 Preview.

The project is a Windows Forms application with .NET Core 3.1.
